## ```L = Linha em que se encontra tal código```

# ```Elementos utilizados```


# ```<Form>```
 The ```<form>```  is a HTML element which is used to represent document section containing interactive controls for submitting information <br>
###  ```L2 e L18```



# ```<lable>```
 The ```<lable>``` HTML element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. <br>
 ### ```L4, L9 e L13```
 ## For
 The for attribute is an allowed attribute for ```<label>``` and ```<output>```. When used on a ```<label>``` element it indicates the form element that this label describes. When used on an ```<output>``` element it allows for an explicit relationship between the elements that represent values which are used in the output. <br>
 ### ```L4, L9 e L13```

# ```<input>```
 The ```<input>``` HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The ```<input>``` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes. <br>
### ```L5 e L10```

 ## ```<input>``` types.
  How an ```<input>```  works varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute, hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages. If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is text. <br>
  
 ### EMAIL type
 ```<input>``` elements of type email are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of email addresses. <br>
### ```L5  ```
 ### Text type
  ```<input>``` elements of type text create basic single-line text fields. <br>
### ```L10```
# ``` <span> ```
The ```<span>``` HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. ```<span>``` is very much like a ```<div>``` element, but ```<div>``` is a block-level element whereas a ```<span>``` is an inline-level element.<br>
### ```L6```
 # ```<textarea>```
 The ```<textarea>``` HTML element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form. <br>
 ###  ```L14```
